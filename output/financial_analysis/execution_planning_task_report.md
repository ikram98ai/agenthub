**Detailed Execution Plans for AAPL Day Trading (High-Risk Tolerance):**

These plans are based on the strategies outlined in the TradingSim article "Apple Stock: 3 Simple Day Trading Strategies," adapted for a high-risk tolerance.  Remember:  High-risk strategies can lead to substantial losses.  Thorough research and understanding of market dynamics are critical before implementation.

**Strategy 1: Trading 2-Day Highs/Lows (High-Risk Adaptation):**

* **Execution:** Identify the 2-day high and low before the market open. Use a 5-minute chart. Enter a long position at the open if the first 5-minute candle closes above the 2-day high, or a short position if it closes below the 2-day low.
* **Risk Management (High-Risk):**  Place stop-loss orders significantly tighter than the standard 1:2 risk/reward ratio. This maximizes potential gains but increases the risk of being stopped out quickly.  Consider using a smaller position size to mitigate risk, even though this reduces potential profits.
* **Target:** Aim for a quick profit of 1-2%, or exit the trade at the nearest round number.
* **High-Risk Element:** The tight stop-loss increases the chance of a losing trade, but significantly increases profit potential on winning trades.


**Strategy 2: Trading Ranges During Low Volatility (High-Risk Adaptation):**

* **Execution:** Use an oscillator (RSI, Stochastics) with a short-term setting (e.g., 7-period RSI). Enter a long position when the oscillator reaches oversold levels (e.g., below 15), or a short position when it reaches overbought levels (e.g., above 85).
* **Risk Management (High-Risk):** Place stop-loss orders at a distance corresponding to a risk of more than 2% of your capital. Alternatively, implement a trailing stop loss order to lock in profits as the price moves favorably.
* **Target:** Aim for a quick profit of 2-3%, or exit the trade at the nearest round number.
* **High-Risk Element:**  Scalping small price movements may require high trade frequency, thus increasing transaction costs and potential for losses if timing is off.  


**Strategy 3: Gap-Fill Strategy (High-Risk Adaptation):**

* **Execution:** Identify gaps from previous days. Enter a long position if the price fills the gap from below, or a short position if it fills from above.  Confirm the entry using an oscillator to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
* **Risk Management (High-Risk):**  Use very tight stop-loss orders based on the gap size, potentially only covering a fraction of the gapâ€™s size.
* **Target:** Aim for profits equal to at least twice the risk amount or exit at the next relevant support or resistance level.
* **High-Risk Element:** Gaps may not always fill, leading to significant losses if stop-loss orders are triggered.
