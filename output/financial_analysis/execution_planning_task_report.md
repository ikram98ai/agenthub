**Detailed Execution Plans for Google (GOOG) Stock Trading (Based on Provided Strategies):**

These plans are illustrative examples and require real-time market data and professional financial advice for actual implementation.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.  All trades involve risk of loss.


**Strategy 1: Swing Trading**

* **Execution:** Identify potential entry points using moving average crossovers (e.g., 50-day MA crossing above 200-day MA) and RSI (oversold conditions, RSI < 30,  might signal a potential buy).   Set a stop-loss order below a recent support level (e.g., a low in the recent price action).   Hold the position for a few days to a few weeks, aiming to capitalize on a price swing. Exit based on technical indicators (e.g., RSI > 70, indicating overbought conditions) or price target.  A trailing stop-loss order can protect profits as the price rises.

* **When:**  Use real-time data to confirm signals from technical analysis tools. Execute the trade during market hours.

* **How:** Use a brokerage account to place orders.

* **Risk Management:** Diversify your portfolio. Use stop-loss and take-profit orders. Position sizing is crucial â€“ never risk more than 1-2% of your portfolio on a single trade.


**Strategy 2: Breakout Trading**

* **Execution:** Identify support and resistance levels on a chart.  If the price breaks above a resistance level with strong volume, enter a long position. Conversely, if it breaks below a support level with strong volume, consider a short position.  Place a stop-loss order just below (long position) or above (short position) the breakout level.


* **When:** Execute the trade immediately upon confirmation of the breakout with increased volume.

* **How:** Use a brokerage account to place limit or market orders.


* **Risk Management:**  Volume confirmation is crucial. Use stop-loss orders. Position sizing is critical.


**Strategy 3: Mean Reversion Strategies**

* **Execution:** Identify overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30) conditions.  Short when overbought and go long when oversold.  This strategy requires careful monitoring and identification of accurate mean reversion points.  Place stop-loss orders.


* **When:** Enter trades when the RSI signals are confirmed by other technical indicators or price action.


* **How:**  Use a brokerage account to place orders.


* **Risk Management:** This strategy is high risk.  Use tight stop-loss orders.  Careful position sizing is crucial.  This strategy should only be employed by experienced traders with a high risk tolerance.


**Strategy 4: Momentum Trading**

* **Execution:** Look for stocks with strong upward momentum.  Identify stocks breaking above key resistance levels with high volume.  Enter a long position when these conditions are confirmed. Use a trailing stop-loss order to protect profits as the price rises.


* **When:** Execute trades immediately after the confirmation of upward momentum, with significant volume.


* **How:** Use a brokerage account to place orders.


* **Risk Management:** Use trailing stop-loss orders to protect profits.  Position sizing is essential.
