Based on my internet search, numerous reputable financial websites offer real-time and historical stock data, price forecasts, and analysis for Google (GOOG).  These resources include Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, MarketWatch, CNBC, Seeking Alpha, and TradingView.  To provide specific insights and alerts on market opportunities or threats for Google,  access to and processing of real-time data using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques are required, which is beyond the scope of my current tools.  The search results show a range of price targets and opinions on Google's future performance.  To obtain a definitive analysis, a more sophisticated data analysis process involving accessing and processing data from these websites directly is necessary.
