I have accessed several websites providing AAPL historical stock data:

* Yahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history/
* Nasdaq: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aapl/historical
* Investing.com: https://www.investing.com/equities/apple-computer-inc-historical-data
* Macrotrends: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/stock-price-history
* Apple Investor Relations: https://investor.apple.com/stock-price/default.aspx
* MarketWatch: https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl/download-data
* WSJ: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL/historical-prices
* Seeking Alpha: https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/historical-price-quotes
* Kaggle (dataset): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarunpaparaju/apple-aapl-historical-stock-data
* Trading Economics: https://tradingeconomics.com/aapl:us

These sources offer various formats (daily, weekly, monthly) and time ranges of historical AAPL stock data.  However,  I am unable to perform the requested statistical modeling and machine learning analysis to provide insights and alerts without access to appropriate tools for that purpose.  The data itself is only useful in the context of such analysis which is beyond my current capabilities.
