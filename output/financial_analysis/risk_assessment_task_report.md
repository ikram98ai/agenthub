**I. Strategy Analysis and Risk Assessment:**

**A. Swing Trading:**

* **Risks:**
    * **Market Risk:**  Unexpected market downturns can lead to significant losses, even with stop-loss orders.  The market might not swing as predicted.
    * **Technical Indicator Failure:**  Over-reliance on technical indicators (MA crossovers, RSI) can lead to false signals and inaccurate entry/exit points.
    * **Missed Opportunities:**  Swing trading may cause traders to miss significant price movements if the swing is short-lived or the exit strategy is poorly timed.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Diversification:** Spread investments across multiple assets to reduce the impact of losses on a single stock.
    * **Multiple Indicator Confirmation:** Use multiple technical indicators to confirm trading signals and reduce the reliance on a single indicator.
    * **Fundamental Analysis:** Supplement technical analysis with fundamental analysis to understand the underlying value and long-term prospects of GOOG.
    * **Stop-Loss Orders:**  Strictly adhere to pre-determined stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.
    * **Position Sizing:**  Never risk more than 1-2% of the trading capital on a single trade.


**B. Breakout Trading:**

* **Risks:**
    * **False Breakouts:**  The price might briefly break through support/resistance levels and then reverse, resulting in losses.
    * **Gaps:**  Large gaps in the price can trigger stop-loss orders prematurely, leading to losses even if the overall trend is favorable.
    * **Market Manipulation:**  The breakout might be manipulated by large traders.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Volume Confirmation:**  Verify breakouts with increased volume to ensure the move is genuine.
    * **Multiple Timeframe Analysis:**  Analyze breakouts across different timeframes (e.g., daily, hourly) to confirm their significance.
    * **Stop-Loss Orders:**  Use tight stop-loss orders just below/above the breakout level to limit losses in case of a false breakout.
    * **Position Sizing:**  Carefully manage position size to limit potential losses.


**C. Mean Reversion Strategies:**

* **Risks:**
    * **High Risk:**  This strategy is inherently high-risk due to the potential for significant price movements in either direction.  A failure to revert to the mean can result in substantial losses.
    * **Market Trends:** This strategy may fail if the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend.
    * **Over-reliance on RSI:** The RSI is just one indicator, and its signals can be unreliable.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Risk Management:** Use very tight stop-loss orders and manage position size carefully.
    * **Multiple Indicator Confirmation:**  Use other technical indicators to confirm RSI signals before entering trades.
    * **Fundamental Analysis:** Consider the company's fundamentals and avoid this strategy when there are significant negative news or events.
    * **Experience:** This strategy is best suited for experienced traders with a high risk tolerance.


**D. Momentum Trading:**

* **Risks:**
    * **Rapid Price Reversals:** Momentum can reverse quickly, leading to losses if not managed properly.
    * **Overbought Conditions:**  Momentum can continue even when the stock is overbought, leading to substantial losses.
    * **Market Corrections:** Momentum strategies can suffer during market corrections.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Trailing Stop-Loss Orders:** Use trailing stop-loss orders to protect profits as the price rises.
    * **Position Sizing:**  Control position size to limit potential losses.
    * **Multiple Indicator Confirmation:**  Use volume and other indicators to validate momentum before entering trades.


**II. Execution Risk:**

* **Risk:**  Errors in order placement, delays in execution, or slippage (the difference between the expected price and the actual execution price) can impact profitability.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Reliable Brokerage:**  Use a reputable brokerage with a robust trading platform and fast execution speeds.
    * **Order Types:** Use appropriate order types (limit orders, stop orders) to control the price and timing of trades.
    * **Technology:** Ensure reliable internet connectivity and trading platform functionality.


**III. Overall Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Diversification:**  Do not put all your capital into one stock, regardless of strategy.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  Only engage in trading strategies aligned with your risk tolerance.  If you're not comfortable with high-risk strategies, avoid them.
* **Backtesting:**  Backtest your strategies thoroughly using historical data before risking real capital.
* **Paper Trading:**  Practice trading with simulated money before using real funds.
* **Continuous Learning:**  Stay updated on market trends, technical analysis techniques, and risk management best practices.
* **Professional Advice:** Consult with a qualified financial advisor to assess your risk tolerance and help you create a trading plan aligned with your financial goals.
