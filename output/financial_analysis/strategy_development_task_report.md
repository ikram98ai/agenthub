Potential Short-Term Trading Strategies for Google (GOOG) - Medium Risk Tolerance

Given the limitations of accessing real-time data and performing advanced analysis, the following are general short-term trading strategies applicable to Google stock with a medium risk tolerance.  These strategies require careful monitoring and risk management.  **Always consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.**

**1. Swing Trading:** This strategy involves holding positions for a few days to a few weeks, capitalizing on short-term price swings.  Look for opportunities based on technical indicators like moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day MA crossover) and relative strength index (RSI) to identify potential entry and exit points.  Set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.

**2. Breakout Trading:** Identify support and resistance levels on Google's chart.  A breakout strategy involves entering a long position when the price breaks above a resistance level (bullish breakout) or a short position when it breaks below a support level (bearish breakout).  Use volume confirmation to increase confidence in the breakout signal.  Again, set stop-loss orders.

**3. Mean Reversion Strategies:** This strategy assumes prices will eventually revert to their average.  Identify overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30) conditions.  Short when overbought and go long when oversold.  This strategy is highly dependent on identifying accurate mean reversion points and requires careful risk management.

**4. Momentum Trading:** This strategy aims to profit from stocks with strong upward momentum.  Look for stocks breaking above key resistance levels and exhibiting high volume.  Identify stocks with positive price trends and potentially strong earning reports.  Use trailing stop-loss orders to protect profits as the price rises.


**Risk Management Considerations (Crucial for Medium Risk Tolerance):**

* **Diversification:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Allocate a portion of your portfolio to Google, but diversify into other assets to mitigate risk.
* **Position Sizing:** Carefully determine the appropriate position size for each trade based on your risk tolerance and available capital.  Never risk more than a small percentage (e.g., 1-2%) of your portfolio on a single trade.
* **Stop-Loss Orders:** Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on each trade.  Place them strategically, considering factors like support levels and volatility.
* **Take-Profit Orders:** Set take-profit orders to lock in profits once a certain price target is reached.  This helps to capitalize on gains and avoid potential reversals.
* **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your positions and adjust your strategy as needed.  Be prepared to exit trades if the market conditions change unexpectedly.
